    # Dictionary defining the phases of incident response and their descriptions
    phases = {
        "1. Preparation": "This proactive phase involves establishing an incident response plan, forming a dedicated response team (with clear roles and responsibilities), acquiring necessary tools (SIEM, EDR, forensics tools), conducting regular training and drills, and assessing risks to critical systems (both IT and OT).",
        "2. Identification": "Detecting and verifying an incident. This involves continuous monitoring via SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR systems, and OT monitoring tools. Key activities include analyzing alerts, recognizing anomalies (e.g., unusual network traffic, unauthorized access attempts, system malfunctions), and initial incident assessment (scoping, severity). User reports are also crucial here.",
        "3. Containment": "Limiting the scope and impact of the incident. Short-term containment might involve isolating affected network segments, blocking malicious IP addresses, or disabling compromised accounts. Long-term containment focuses on more robust measures while eradication strategies are developed.",
        "4. Eradication": "Removing the threat actor and malicious components from the environment. This includes eliminating malware, remediating vulnerabilities that were exploited, and ensuring no backdoors remain. For OT systems, this requires careful coordination to maintain operational safety.",
        "5. Recovery": "Restoring affected systems and services to normal operation securely. This involves restoring from clean backups, validating system integrity, monitoring for any signs of reinfection, and a phased return to service. For rail operations, safety and service continuity are paramount.",
        "6. Post-Incident Analysis (Lessons Learned)": "A critical phase conducted after the incident is resolved. It involves a detailed review to understand the root cause, the effectiveness of the response, and areas for improvement. Document findings, update the incident response plan, refine security controls, and share lessons with relevant stakeholders. This feeds back into the Preparation phase."

        * **NIS2 Directive:** Significant incidents impacting essential services (like rail transport) must be reported to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) with an early warning within **24 hours** of becoming aware, and a detailed notification within **72 hours**. A final report is typically due within one month.
        * **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** Personal data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection Commission (DPC) within **72 hours** of becoming aware, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Affected individuals may also need to be notified.
        * **Preserve Evidence:** Maintain detailed logs and forensic evidence throughout the response process for internal analysis, regulatory reporting, and potential legal action.
        * **Communication Plan:** Have a clear internal and external communication plan. This includes notifying management, legal teams, PR, and potentially customers or the public, depending on the incident's nature and severity.
        * **Regular Drills:** Conduct tabletop exercises and full simulation drills to test your incident response plan and team readiness.
        * **IT/OT Convergence:** Pay special attention to incidents that may span both IT and Operational Technology (OT) environments, ensuring response strategies consider the unique safety and operational requirements of OT systems in rail.
