        In today's interconnected world, the rail and wider transportation sectors are increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyber threats. 
        These threats aren't just digital inconveniences; they can cause significant operational disruption, lead to substantial financial losses, 
        damage public trust, and even compromise passenger and staff safety. At Iarnr√≥d √âireann, where the reliability and security of our services 
        are paramount, fostering a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness among all staff is not just beneficial‚Äîit's essential.

        Understanding the potential impact of cyber incidents, and learning from real-world examples, helps us all appreciate the importance 
        of our individual roles in protecting our organisation.
